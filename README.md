Chess final project
===================

A final project for the course [Software Project](http://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~roded/courses/soft-project17b.html) taken spring 2017 in Tel Aviv Universtiy.

The project includes an almost complete implementation of chess in C (lacking only draw by repetition and 50-moves draw) together with a GUI written using SDL2 and an AI opponent to play against using the Minmax search algorithm with alpha-beta pruning.

Bonus features of the project which were implemented are:
* Castling
* Promotions
* En Passant captures
* Ability to view all possible piece moves in advance
* A stronger, level 5, AI opponent using better move-score heuristing to search more likely moves earlier and increase the number of moves pruned

The project was built in colleboration with Tomer Schneider.
